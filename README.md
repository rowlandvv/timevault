# Time Vault - STX Locking Smart Contract

A production-ready smart contract for the Stacks blockchain that enables secure time-locked STX deposits with dynamic reward mechanisms.

## üåü Overview

Time Vault is an innovative DeFi protocol that allows users to lock their STX tokens for specified periods and earn rewards proportional to their commitment. The longer you lock, the higher your rewards!

### Key Features

- **üîí Flexible Locking Periods**: Lock STX from 1 day to 365 days
- **üí∞ Dynamic Rewards**: Base 5% APY with up to 0.5% bonus per month locked (max 20% APY)
- **üè¶ Multiple Vaults**: Create up to 100 vaults per wallet
- **üö® Emergency Withdraw**: Exit early with a 10% penalty
- **üëÆ Admin Controls**: Pause mechanism and reward pool management
- **üõ°Ô∏è Battle-Tested Security**: Comprehensive validation and reentrancy protection

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Creating Your First Vault

```clarity
;; Lock 1000 STX for 30 days
(contract-call? .time-vault create-vault u1000000000 u4320)
;; Returns: (ok u1) - Your vault ID
```

```clarity
;; Get all your vault IDs
(contract-call? .time-vault get-user-vaults tx-sender)

;; Get specific vault details
(contract-call? .time-vault get-vault tx-sender u1)
```

### Claiming Rewards

```clarity
;; After lock period expires
(contract-call? .time-vault claim-vault u1)
;; Returns: (ok { amount: u1000000000, rewards: u50000000 })
```

## üèóÔ∏è Contract Architecture

### Data Structures

```clarity
;; Vault Structure
{
    amount: uint,              ;; Locked STX amount
    lock-start: uint,          ;; Start block height
    lock-end: uint,            ;; End block height
    reward-rate: uint,         ;; APY in basis points
    claimed: bool,             ;; Claim status
    emergency-withdrawn: bool  ;; Emergency withdraw status
}
```

### State Variables

- `total-locked`: Total STX locked in all vaults
- `total-rewards-distributed`: Cumulative rewards paid out
- `reward-pool`: Available rewards for distribution
- `contract-paused`: Emergency pause state
- `vault-nonce`: Auto-incrementing vault ID

### Error Codes

| Code | Error | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| u100 | err-owner-only | Function restricted to contract owner |
| u101 | err-insufficient-balance | Not enough balance for operation |
| u102 | err-invalid-amount | Amount must be greater than 0 |
| u103 | err-invalid-duration | Duration outside allowed range |
| u104 | err-vault-not-found | Vault ID doesn't exist |
| u105 | err-vault-locked | Vault still in lock period |
| u106 | err-already-claimed | Vault already claimed/withdrawn |
| u107 | err-contract-paused | Contract is paused |
| u108 | err-insufficient-rewards | Not enough rewards in pool |
| u109 | err-unauthorized | Unauthorized access |

## üö¢ Deployment

### Mainnet Deployment Checklist

1. **Audit Contract**
   - [ ] Internal review
   - [ ] External audit
   - [ ] Fix all findings

2. **Prepare Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Set network to mainnet
   clarinet deployments generate --mainnet
   
   # Review deployment plan
   cat deployments/default.mainnet-plan.yaml
   ```

3. **Initial Configuration**
   ```clarity
   ;; After deployment, initialize reward pool
   (contract-call? .time-vault add-rewards u10000000000000)
   ```

4. **Monitor Contract**
   - Set up monitoring for `total-locked`
   - Track reward pool balance
   - Monitor emergency withdrawals

### Deployment Parameters

```yaml
time-vault:
  initial-reward-pool: 10000 STX
  min-lock-duration: 144 blocks (~1 day)
  max-lock-duration: 52560 blocks (~365 days)
  base-reward-rate: 500 (5% APY)
  penalty-rate: 1000 (10%)
```

## üîí Security

### Security Features

1. **Reentrancy Protection**: State updates before external calls
2. **Integer Overflow Protection**: Safe math operations
3. **Access Control**: Owner-only admin functions
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
5. **Emergency Pause**: Circuit breaker mechanism

### Best Practices

- Always test on testnet first
- Monitor contract state regularly
- Keep reward pool funded
- Have incident response plan
- Regular security audits

### Known Limitations

- Maximum 100 vaults per user
- Rewards capped at 20% APY
- No vault transfer mechanism
- Admin cannot access locked funds

## ‚ö° Gas Optimization

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Efficient Storage**
   - Packed struct design
   - Minimal state variables
   - Indexed mapping access

2. **Batch Operations**
   - User vault list for enumeration
   - Single read for multiple vaults

3. **Calculation Optimization**
   - Pre-computed constants
   - Efficient reward math

### Gas Estimates

| Operation | Estimated Cost |
|-----------|----------------|
| Create Vault | ~0.02 STX |
| Claim Vault | ~0.015 STX |
| Emergency Withdraw | ~0.015 STX |
| Get Vault Info | ~0.001 STX |
